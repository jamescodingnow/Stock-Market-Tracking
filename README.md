1. Firstly created data/local/CompanyListingEntity to get server response with remote/StockApi.
2. Crated domain/model/CompanyListing data class to use server response in app.
3. However, we cannot use CompanyListingEntity in app pages or ViewModels. So, we need to have a converter or mapper.
4. data/mapper/CompanyMapper is a mapper for the converting between CompanyListingEntity and CompanyListing each other.
5. There is a database as StockDatabase.
6. Our database functions are in StockDao.

8. Resource sealed class has Success, Error and Loading classes.
9. Create domain/repository/StockRepository as interface.
10. data/repository/StockRepositoryImpl has all data fetching logic.
